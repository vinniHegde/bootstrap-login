# bootstrap-login
The code has a general flow of logging in where a new user will register himself, while an existing user will log in using the credentials through which he/she has registered.
Along with these two features, I have added a new feature to retrieve the password by having forgot password option. After successful login it redirects the page to invesis home page.
Please login through the given credentials.
